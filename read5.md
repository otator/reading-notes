# CSS
**CSS** *stands for Cascading Style Sheets* it styles the webpages.<br>
css has the responsibility of styling webpages by changing the colors, fonts, images etc..<br>

it reduces the repetition of writing the code over and over for each page, since it allow to write the code once 
and use it in any page by using **link** tag in the **head** tag, and when modification needed, it done once on this file.<br>

## Colors in CSS
in order to change html element color, css gives the ability to do that in separate file. <br>
colors mainly in a mix of three main color red, green and blue.
colors in css can be represented in many way:<br>
* ***Hexadecimal representation:** in this way, colors could be written using hexadecimal digits, each color has 6 digits and starts with **#**<br>
for example black color in hexadicimal representation is: **#000000**, and white color is **#ffffff**.*

* ***RGB (Red Green Blue):** in this representation the colors is being written by specifying how much of each color of the three in this color
for example red color has no green nor blue so it is written as this **RGB(255,0,0)** where each color starts from 0 to 255.*

* ***Colors by names:** css gives the ability to write or choose color by thier names, but the color represented this way are limited by number.* <br>


**and one of the styling ways css gives, is the opacity, the opacity of color can be modified in css in ordered to have better design as desired. <br>
to change color opacity, we use rgba(r,g,b), for example to change the blue color opacity to half rgba(0,0,255,0.5) where 0.5 in 50% of the color opacity,
and 0.0 for 0% and 1.0 for 100%.**
