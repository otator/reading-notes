# Javascript
### javascript is a programming language just like python and c++
javascript is used to do the actions in the webpage. For example, when a button is clicked, javascript function executed 
to perform some action.
<br>

as any other languages javascripts has its own rules **syntax**, and to write correct code, following these rules is a must.
<br>

for example to declare a variable with value 15, we need to use the keyword **var** to tell the browser (**the interpreter**) that
we are decalring a variable, then the name of the varible for example, **temprature** then we need to assign the value 15 to the variable temperature, to do that **=** *(equal sign)* must be used an all the sentence will be: **var temprature = 15;**
here we must tell the interpreter that this line ended by typing **;** *(semicolon)*
<br>

there more than one way to write javascript
* way one: is to write the javascript within the html code by using **script open and close tags**, but this way is not 
recomendded since the browser must stop loading the script once he sees the script tag, and this make the loadin slower.
* way two: is two write the the javascript code indivisually in seperate file, and refer to the script by adding script source.
