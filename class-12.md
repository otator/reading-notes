# Canvas 
to create animation we use canvas library, it is already exists and ready to use inside Chart.js.<br>
first the Chart.js needs to be donwloaded in order to use it.<br>
then simply import the script within html code as below:<br>
```html
<head>
  <script src="Chart.min.js"></script>
</head>
```
to draw a line in canvas:<br>
```html
<canvas id="line" width="80%" height="200px"></canvas>
```

canvas used to draw animation, charts, and figures.<br>

comming soon...
