# HTML 
in order to have an html page first 
you need to tell the browser what version of html you are using
by typing the follwing statment in the top of your code ### !DOCTYPE html tag

then you must encapsulate your code with html open and close tags, then every html page has two part.
* First part is the head where your you add the title that 
appear on the tab name, and the meta data to tell search engines about your site
**Every thing you type in the _head_ tag will not be shown in the main page.**
* Second part is the body where all the content inside this tag will show up in 
the main page
there are many other tags to structure your webpage using html 
**div tag** used to divide the page into divisions 
**p tag** to add a paragraph,
_You can add text directly by typing it without any tags but it is recommented to have them inside proper tag in order to refer to them later and change thier style using css if needed_
