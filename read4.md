# HTML 
### HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
**It's not a programming language, just a markup language which struct the web page**
<br>
in order to have an html page, first 
you need to tell the browser what version of html you are using
by typing the follwing statment in the top of your code __!DOCTYPE__ tag

then you must encapsulate your code with html open and close tags, then every html page has two part.
* First part is the head where your you add the title that 
appear on the tab name, and the meta data to tell search engines about your site
**Every thing you type in the _head_ tag will not be shown in the main page.**
* Second part is the body where all the content inside this tag will show up in 
the main page.
<br>
there are many other tags to struct your webpage using html.
<br>
**div tag** used to divide the page into divisions 
**p tag** to add a paragraph,
_You can add text directly by typing it without any tags but it is recommented to have them inside proper tags in order to refer to them later and change their style using css if needed._

# HTML5
**the last version of html.**
<br>
In this version many elements had been added in order to divide the web page along with **div** tag.
and these elements do pretty much the same as their names. For example **article tag** is for writing the articles
in the web page, which mainly come in the middle of the main division, and the **aside** tag that allows to write 
the content of it to the side of the page.
**header** and **footer** tags are also *html5* tags, these tags had been found to enhance the view of the page
where the content of these tags stays the same in all the website pages, where the these elements appear in the top and the
bottom of the webpage, and these one of the benifits of these tags to allow screen reader to ignore them so that the user can foucs on the main content.
