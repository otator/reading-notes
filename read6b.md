# Computers
### Computer is a device that do computing

## What makes a computer a computer?
there are four main tasks to perform that makes a device a computer:
* **Input**
* **Store**
* **Process**
* **Output**
### Input
A computer must have the ability to gain input from users, from the keyboard as text or numbers,
from the microphone as voice or from the camera and other inputs.
### Store
A computer must be able to store the input data into storage like RAM or Hard Desk.
### Process
A computer need to do processes to the stored data.
### Output 
A computer must be able to out the data as song, video, or even a webpage.

## Binary Representation of data
Computer only know either 1 or 0, true or false, on or off<br>
so all data must be converted to binary digits before storing and processing, all the data can be represent as
numbers, for example the letter 'A' has the number 65 representing it in order to store it in the memory or display it to the screen 
this number converted to binary digits and this value became 01000001, and this number is being stored inside the memory as electrical signal. 
this operation can be applied to all kind of data, for Example the voice data is being representing as binary by converting the frequency to numbers then to binary.

## Logical Circuits
Central Processing Unit **CPU** is like the brain of humans, this chip consists of many other chips, for example there is the Arithmetic Logical Unit chip **ALU** which responsible of logical operations, Instruction Registers **IR** that where the instruction is being saved to be used later, Control Unit and many other chips.<br>
each one of these chips consists of millions of logical gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NOR and other kinds of logical gates.
For example the AND gate has two input and one output, the out put of this gate will be 0 if on of the two inputs is zero 
and it will output 1 if the both two inputs are ones.
one XOR gate and on AND gate connected in a specific way, they can add two bits, 8 of the same connection of these gates can add numbers up to 255 and 32 of these gates can add numbers more than 4 billion.
