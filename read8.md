# Loops
a loop in java script is a block that can be repeated many times as desired.<br>

*Javascript has two kinds of loop **while loops** and **for loop** <br>

### For Loop
it is used when we know exactly how many times we want to repeat the code within the loop.<br>
to have a loop that repeat itself. First must initialize a variable to start from and a condition to meet to stop executing
and must update the counter as desired to repeat the code within as we want.
so the structure will be like:

```javascript
for(var i=0; i<=10; i++){
    //code that will repeated or executed 10 times.
}
```

## While Loop
it is used when we want the loop to keep executing until a condition will meet.<br>
while loop structure is as the following
```javascript
var i = 0;
while(i<10){
    //code that will repeated or executed 10 times.
}
```
