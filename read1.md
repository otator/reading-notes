Having growth mindset helps you to achive what you do better and it will make successful person. in the other hand if you have a fixed mindset, it won't make you achieve anything but little stuff.

if you have a fixed mindset you can follow these steps to go back to the growth mindset zone First you need to face the problem you have in a different way, try to think in a different solution Second if you need to make an ispiration of others success instead of feeling jealous.

Third, you might need to not avoid critcisim and learn from what people judge.

Finally, you have to keep memorise yourself that you have a growth mindset. for me I remind my self with the following statments

I'm capable of fixing the problem that I'm facing, but I will give some time.
I can be more productive if just focus on the problem.
no pain no gai
